# Swerve-Sim
#### Work done during summer 2023 on an example swerve API featuring 3D visualization (AdvantageScope), control based on second-order kinematics, and an *unfinished* simulator (see below). The project is based on WPILib version 2023.4.3.

- ## Current Status (9/8/23)
  Most interface/utility classes are complete and could be used as a base for driving an actual swerve base, however, the general driver/container class is unfinished.
The simulator is theoretically functional but not fully tested. Due to time limitations of this project/repo, further development of the simulation can be found [here](https://github.com/S1ink/Swerve-Simulation).
